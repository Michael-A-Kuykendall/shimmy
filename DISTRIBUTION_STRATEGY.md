# Shimmy Distribution Strategy

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition
**"From LoRA training to production API in under 30 seconds."**

Shimmy solves the developer pain point: You just trained a useful LoRA adapter with Unsloth/PEFT/Axolotl, now you want to serve it immediately without conversion hassles.

## 📦 Distribution Channels

### 1. 🚀 **Primary: Cargo/crates.io** 
```bash
# The main distribution - Rust developers expect this
cargo install shimmy --features llama
shimmy serve --auto-discover ./my-training-output/
```

**Advantages:**
- Native Rust ecosystem integration  
- Automatic dependency management
- Cross-platform compilation
- Developer-friendly installation

### 2. 🔧 **VS Code Extension: High Value Target**

**Why VS Code extension makes perfect sense:**
- 🎯 **Developer workflow integration** - training happens in notebooks/code
- 🔥 **Hot reload during development** - test LoRA immediately  
- 📊 **Model switching UI** - visual adapter management
- 🚀 **One-click serving** - right-click → "Serve with Shimmy"

**VS Code Extension Features:**
```typescript
// Shimmy VS Code Extension capabilities
- Auto-discover LoRA adapters in workspace
- Right-click context menu: "Serve with Shimmy"  
- Status bar: Model serving indicator
- Terminal integration: shimmy commands
- Settings: configure ports, models directory
- Language Model API integration (future)
```

**Popular AI Extensions for Reference:**
```vscode-extensions
continue.continue,github.copilot,codeium.codeium,sourcegraph.cody-ai
```

### 3. 📦 **GitHub Releases**
```bash
# Direct binary downloads
wget https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/shimmy/releases/download/v0.1.0/shimmy-linux-x64
chmod +x shimmy-linux-x64 && ./shimmy-linux-x64 serve
```

### 4. 🐳 **Docker Hub** (Optional)
```bash
# For containerized deployments
docker run -p 11435:11435 -v ./models:/models shimmy:latest
```

## 🎯 **VS Code Extension Priority Assessment**

**HIGH PRIORITY ✅** - Here's why:

### Developer Workflow Alignment
```bash
# Typical ML developer workflow:
1. Open VS Code with training notebook
2. Run: unsloth.train(model="phi3", dataset=my_data) 
3. Get: ./output/adapter_model.safetensors
4. Want: Immediate testing/serving
5. Shimmy: Right-click → "Serve with Shimmy" 
```

### Market Validation
- **Continue.dev**: 1.5M installs (local AI coding)
- **Cody**: 721k installs (AI assistant)  
- **Codeium**: 3M installs (AI completion)
- **GitHub Copilot**: 48M installs (shows demand)

### Technical Feasibility 
```typescript
// VS Code extension would:
1. Detect LoRA files in workspace
2. Launch shimmy subprocess  
3. Provide UI for model management
4. Integrate with VS Code Language Model API
```

## 📋 **Documentation Strategy**

### 1. **README.md Focus**
- Lead with the developer pain point story
- 30-second quick start
- LoRA workflow integration examples

### 2. **DEVELOPER_STORY.md** (Already created)
- Why Shimmy exists narrative
- Before/after comparison
- Training framework integration

### 3. **VS Code Extension README**
```markdown
# Shimmy VS Code Extension

## Instant LoRA Serving in Your IDE

Just trained a LoRA adapter? Serve it instantly without leaving VS Code.

### Features
- 🔍 Auto-discover LoRA adapters in workspace
- 🚀 One-click model serving
- 📊 Visual model management
- 🔧 Integrated terminal commands

### Quick Start
1. Train your LoRA (Unsloth, PEFT, etc.)
2. Right-click on adapter_model.safetensors  
3. Select "Serve with Shimmy"
4. Start coding with your custom model!
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Implementation Order**

1. ✅ **Polish main README** with developer story focus
2. ✅ **Publish to crates.io** as primary distribution  
3. 🚀 **Create VS Code extension** (high-impact, aligns with workflow)
4. 📦 **GitHub releases** for direct downloads
5. 🐳 **Docker images** if demand emerges

## 💡 **Key Marketing Messages**

**For Tool Documentation:**
- "The missing piece between LoRA training and LoRA deployment"
- "Zero-config LoRA inference server"  
- "From SafeTensors to production API in 30 seconds"

**For VS Code Extension:**
- "Instant LoRA serving in your IDE"
- "Test your trained models without leaving your workspace"
- "One-click deployment for ML experiments"

The VS Code extension is the **highest-impact** distribution channel because it integrates directly into the developer workflow where LoRA training happens.
