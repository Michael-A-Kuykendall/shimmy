# Feature 001 â€” Smart Model Preloading & Warmup System

## Intent
Eliminate the 2-30 second model loading delay that users experience on first requests by intelligently preloading popular models based on usage patterns and explicit configuration.

## Problem Statement
Currently, Shimmy users experience significant latency on first requests to new models:
- Cold start model loading takes 2-30 seconds depending on model size
- This delay creates poor user experience and breaks real-time applications
- Popular models get loaded repeatedly, wasting resources
- No intelligent prediction of which models should be preloaded

Production deployments need predictable, fast response times for all requests, especially in user-facing applications.

## User Stories

### As a Production Operator
- I want popular models preloaded automatically so that users never experience cold start delays
- I want configurable preloading policies so that I can optimize for my specific workload patterns
- I want visibility into preloading effectiveness so that I can measure the performance improvement

### As a Developer
- I want my first API request to be as fast as subsequent requests so that my application has consistent performance
- I want to specify which models should be preloaded so that I can optimize for my application's needs
- I want preloading to happen in the background so that it doesn't slow down Shimmy startup

### As an End User
- I want fast response times on all requests so that AI features feel responsive
- I want consistent performance so that I have a predictable experience

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Background Preloading**: Load models in background threads without blocking main operations
- **Usage-Based Intelligence**: Learn which models to preload based on request patterns
- **Configuration Options**: Support explicit preloading lists and policies
- **Memory Management**: Respect memory limits and evict unused preloaded models
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor preloading effectiveness and hit rates

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Startup Time**: Preloading must not impact sub-2-second startup requirement
- **Memory Efficiency**: Preloaded models must respect overall memory constraints
- **Background Loading**: Model loading happens asynchronously without blocking requests
- **Hit Rate Target**: 80%+ of requests should hit preloaded models in steady state
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All preloading features respect architectural constraints

## Success Criteria

### User Success
- **Consistent Performance**: First requests are as fast as subsequent requests
- **Predictable Latency**: 95% of requests complete within 500ms after warmup
- **Transparent Operation**: Preloading works automatically without user configuration

### Technical Success
- **High Hit Rate**: 80%+ preload cache hit rate for steady-state workloads
- **Fast Startup**: Startup time remains under 2 seconds
- **Memory Efficiency**: Preloaded models consume <50% of available memory
- **Background Processing**: Model loading doesn't block request processing

## What We Are NOT Building
- **Complex ML Prediction**: Keep preloading logic simple and predictable
- **Distributed Preloading**: Focus on single-instance optimization
- **External Dependencies**: No external databases or services required
- **Complex Eviction Policies**: Use simple LRU-based eviction

## Core Capabilities

### Intelligent Preloading
- Track model usage patterns and popularity scores
- Automatically preload top 3-5 most popular models
- Learn from access patterns over time

### Background Processing
- Asynchronous model loading in background threads
- Non-blocking startup and request processing
- Progress tracking and status reporting

### Memory Management
- Configurable memory limits for preloaded models
- LRU eviction when memory pressure detected
- Smart preloading based on available resources

### Performance Monitoring
- Track preload hit rates and effectiveness
- Monitor memory usage and loading times
- Provide metrics for optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Models preload in background without blocking startup
- [ ] Usage tracking learns popular models automatically
- [ ] Hit rate exceeds 80% for steady-state workloads
- [ ] Memory usage stays within configured limits
- [ ] Startup time remains under 2 seconds
- [ ] Preloading can be configured via CLI and config files
- [ ] Metrics show preloading effectiveness
- [ ] Constitutional compliance maintained throughout

## Edge Cases & Error Conditions
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Gracefully handle out-of-memory conditions
- **Model Loading Failures**: Continue operating when specific models fail to preload
- **Rapid Model Changes**: Handle scenarios where model preferences change quickly
- **Resource Constraints**: Adapt preloading behavior based on available resources

## Constitutional Compliance Check
- [x] **Lightweight Binary**: Preloading features designed for minimal size impact
- [x] **Sub-2-Second Startup**: Background loading preserves startup performance
- [x] **Zero Python Dependencies**: Pure Rust implementation
- [x] **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Preloading is transparent to API consumers
- [x] **Library-First**: Preloading engine can be used as standalone component
- [x] **CLI Interface**: All preloading features accessible via command line
- [x] **Test-First**: Comprehensive test coverage for preloading logic

## Integration with Existing Features
- **Model Manager**: Extend existing model management with preloading capabilities
- **Request Processing**: Integrate with request pipeline for seamless operation
- **Configuration System**: Leverage existing configuration mechanisms
- **Metrics Collection**: Provide data for observability systems
