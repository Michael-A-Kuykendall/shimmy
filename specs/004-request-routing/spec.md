# Feature 004 â€” Request Routing & Connection Intelligence

## Intent
Provide intelligent request routing and connection management capabilities that enable multi-model support, load balancing, and resilient failover while maintaining Shimmy's lightweight architecture and constitutional principles.

## Problem Statement
Currently, Shimmy serves one model per instance. Production environments need the ability to:
- Run multiple models simultaneously for different use cases
- Automatically route requests to appropriate model instances
- Provide failover when specific models become unavailable
- Balance load across multiple instances of the same model
- Maintain connection intelligence for optimal performance

## User Stories

### As a Production Operator
- I want to run multiple Shimmy instances with different models so that I can serve various AI workloads from a single deployment
- I want automatic failover when a model instance becomes unavailable so that my service remains resilient
- I want load balancing across model instances so that I can handle high traffic volumes

### As a Developer
- I want to request any available model without knowing which instance serves it so that my application code stays simple
- I want automatic retries and fallbacks so that temporary issues don't break my application
- I want visibility into routing decisions so that I can troubleshoot performance issues

### As a System Administrator
- I want health monitoring of all model instances so that I can proactively address issues
- I want routing metrics and analytics so that I can optimize my deployment
- I want configuration flexibility so that I can adapt to different traffic patterns

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Multi-Model Registry**: Support multiple models across different Shimmy instances
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks for all registered model instances
- **Request Routing**: Intelligent routing based on model availability and performance
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across healthy instances of the same model
- **Failover Logic**: Automatic routing around failed or degraded instances
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management and reuse

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Routing Latency**: <1ms overhead for request routing decisions
- **Health Check Frequency**: 30-second intervals with fast failure detection (<5s)
- **Failover Time**: <5 seconds to detect and route around failures
- **Memory Overhead**: <50MB additional memory for routing logic
- **Concurrent Connections**: Support 1000+ concurrent connections
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Must not violate 5MB limit or 2s startup time

## Success Criteria

### User Success
- **Transparent Multi-Model Access**: Users can request any model without knowing instance details
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime through automatic failover
- **Predictable Performance**: Consistent response times through intelligent routing

### Technical Success
- **Low Overhead**: Routing adds <1ms latency to requests
- **Fast Recovery**: Failures detected and routed around within 5 seconds
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Connection pooling reduces resource overhead by 50%
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All features respect Shimmy's architectural constraints

## What We Are NOT Building
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Keep routing lightweight, avoid complex service mesh features
- **Cross-Datacenter Routing**: Focus on single-cluster/single-region deployments
- **Complex Load Balancing Algorithms**: Stick to simple, proven algorithms (round-robin, least-connections)
- **Distributed State Management**: Avoid complex consensus protocols or distributed databases

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multiple Shimmy instances can be registered and discovered
- [ ] Health checks accurately detect instance failures within 5 seconds
- [ ] Requests automatically route around unhealthy instances
- [ ] Load balancing distributes requests evenly across healthy instances
- [ ] Routing overhead adds <1ms to request latency
- [ ] System supports 1000+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Configuration is simple and follows Shimmy's CLI-first approach
- [ ] All existing single-instance functionality remains unchanged
- [ ] Memory usage stays within 50MB additional overhead
- [ ] Integration maintains OpenAI API compatibility

## Edge Cases & Error Conditions
- **All Instances Fail**: Return meaningful error when no healthy instances available
- **Network Partitions**: Handle temporary connectivity issues gracefully
- **Slow Instances**: Route around instances with high latency
- **Configuration Errors**: Provide clear error messages for misconfigurations
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Degrade gracefully when connection limits reached

## Constitutional Compliance Check
- [x] **5MB Binary Limit**: Routing features are lightweight, designed for minimal size impact
- [x] **Sub-2-Second Startup**: Routing initialization is fast, no impact on startup time
- [x] **Zero Python Dependencies**: Pure Rust implementation
- [x] **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Routing is transparent to API consumers
- [x] **Library-First**: Routing engine can be used as standalone library
- [x] **CLI Interface**: All routing features accessible via command line
- [x] **Test-First**: Comprehensive test suite will be implemented before routing logic

## Integration with Existing Features
- **Model Preloading**: Route to instances with preloaded models when available
- **Response Caching**: Cache responses regardless of which instance served them
- **Integration Templates**: Update templates to support multi-instance deployments
- **GPU Backends**: Route based on GPU availability and capabilities
- **Auto-Discovery**: Integrate with existing model discovery mechanisms
