# Feature 002 â€” Response Caching & Deduplication Engine

## Intent
Dramatically improve performance and reduce computational load by intelligently caching and deduplicating identical inference requests, providing instant responses for repeated queries.

## Problem Statement
AI inference is computationally expensive and time-consuming:
- Identical prompts generate the same responses but require full computation each time
- Users frequently ask similar or identical questions
- Development and testing scenarios involve repeated identical requests
- No mechanism exists to avoid redundant computation

Production deployments need to maximize throughput while minimizing computational overhead.

## User Stories

### As a Production Operator
- I want identical requests cached automatically so that my infrastructure handles more users with less compute
- I want configurable cache policies so that I can optimize for my specific workload patterns
- I want cache hit rate visibility so that I can measure the performance benefits

### As a Developer
- I want repeated API calls during development to be instant so that my iteration cycle is faster
- I want testing to be fast so that I can run comprehensive test suites quickly
- I want cache behavior to be configurable so that I can disable it when testing non-deterministic features

### As an End User
- I want fast responses to common questions so that AI interactions feel instant
- I want consistent answers to identical questions so that the system feels reliable

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Intelligent Caching**: Cache responses based on request fingerprints (model + prompt + parameters)
- **TTL Management**: Configurable time-to-live for cached responses
- **LRU Eviction**: Remove least recently used entries when cache reaches size limits
- **Cache Statistics**: Track hit rates, miss rates, and performance metrics
- **Configurable Policies**: Support enabling/disabling cache and customizing behavior

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Cache Lookup Speed**: <1ms for cache hit/miss determination
- **Memory Efficiency**: Configurable memory limits with automatic cleanup
- **Thread Safety**: Safe concurrent access across request threads
- **Storage Efficiency**: Efficient serialization and compression of cached responses
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Minimal impact on binary size and startup time

## Success Criteria

### User Success
- **Instant Responses**: Cached requests return within 10ms
- **Transparent Operation**: Caching works automatically without changing API behavior
- **Reliable Deduplication**: Identical requests always return identical responses

### Technical Success
- **High Hit Rate**: 20-40% cache hit rate for typical workloads
- **Fast Lookups**: Cache operations add <1ms latency
- **Memory Efficiency**: Cache uses configurable memory limits effectively
- **Performance Gain**: 10x speed improvement for cached responses

## What We Are NOT Building
- **Persistent Cache**: Focus on in-memory caching for simplicity
- **Distributed Caching**: Single-instance cache to avoid complexity
- **Semantic Caching**: Avoid ML-based similarity matching
- **External Dependencies**: No Redis or external cache systems

## Core Capabilities

### Request Fingerprinting
- Generate unique keys based on model name, prompt content, and inference parameters
- Handle parameter variations appropriately (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
- Ensure deterministic key generation for identical requests

### Cache Management
- LRU eviction policy with configurable size limits
- TTL-based expiration with automatic cleanup
- Memory-efficient storage with optional compression
- Thread-safe concurrent access

### Performance Optimization
- Fast hash-based lookups for cache hits
- Background cleanup to maintain performance
- Configurable cache warming strategies
- Statistics collection for optimization

### Configuration Flexibility
- Enable/disable caching globally or per-model
- Configurable size limits and TTL values
- Development mode with cache bypass options
- Runtime cache statistics and management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identical requests return cached responses within 10ms
- [ ] Cache hit rate exceeds 20% for development workloads
- [ ] Memory usage stays within configured limits
- [ ] Cache operations add <1ms latency to uncached requests
- [ ] TTL expiration works correctly for time-sensitive responses
- [ ] LRU eviction maintains cache size within limits
- [ ] Cache can be disabled without affecting functionality
- [ ] Statistics provide actionable performance insights
- [ ] Constitutional compliance maintained throughout

## Edge Cases & Error Conditions
- **Memory Pressure**: Gracefully reduce cache size when memory constrained
- **Cache Corruption**: Handle serialization/deserialization errors
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Properly handle floating-point parameter variations
- **Clock Changes**: Handle system time changes gracefully

## Constitutional Compliance Check
- [x] **Lightweight Binary**: Caching features designed for minimal size impact
- [x] **Sub-2-Second Startup**: Cache initialization is fast
- [x] **Zero Python Dependencies**: Pure Rust implementation
- [x] **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Caching is transparent to API consumers
- [x] **Library-First**: Caching engine can be used as standalone component
- [x] **CLI Interface**: Cache management accessible via command line
- [x] **Test-First**: Comprehensive test coverage for caching logic

## Privacy & Security Considerations
- **No Persistent Storage**: Cache exists only in memory during runtime
- **Configurable Privacy**: Users can disable caching for sensitive workloads
- **Memory Cleanup**: Ensure cached responses are properly cleaned from memory
- **Parameter Handling**: Avoid logging sensitive parameters in cache keys

## Integration with Existing Features
- **Request Pipeline**: Integrate seamlessly with request processing flow
- **Model Management**: Work with all supported model types and formats
- **Configuration System**: Leverage existing configuration mechanisms
- **Observability**: Provide metrics for monitoring and optimization
