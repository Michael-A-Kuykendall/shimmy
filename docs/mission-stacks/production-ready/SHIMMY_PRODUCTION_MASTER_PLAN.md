# Shimmy Production Readiness Master Plan

## Mission Statement
Transform shimmy into the **perfect local inference shim** - a single-binary, zero-config, production-ready GGUF + LoRA server with OpenAI compatibility that "just works" for developers building AI applications.

## Current State Assessment (Based on Punch Analysis)
- ‚úÖ **Core Architecture**: Solid foundation with GGUF + LoRA support
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI Compatibility**: 90% complete (`/v1/chat/completions` endpoint exists)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Discovery**: Implemented but not integrated
- ‚úÖ **HTTP/SSE/WebSocket**: Working endpoints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Technical Debt**: 38 compiler warnings, unused code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Integration Gaps**: Features exist but not wired together

## Gate-Based Execution Plan

2. **Verification-Driven**: Each gate has clear, testable success criteria
3. **No Scope Creep**: Focus only on making shimmy perfect at being a shim
4. **Speed of Execution**: Leverage existing 80% complete features

## Timeline Estimate

- **Gate 1**: 2-3 hours (cleanup and foundation)
- **Gate 2**: 3-4 hours (OpenAI compatibility)
- **Gate 3**: 2-3 hours (auto-discovery integration)
- **Gate 4**: 4-5 hours (hot model management)
- **Gate 5**: 3-4 hours (production hardening)
- **Gate 6**: 2-3 hours (documentation and polish)

**Total**: 16-22 hours of focused development

## Post-Production

Once all gates are complete, shimmy will be:
- **The fastest** local inference shim available
- **Zero-config** for common development scenarios  
- **OpenAI-compatible** with all major AI tools
- **Production-ready** for serious deployments
- **Single-binary** simplicity

This positions shimmy as the obvious choice for developers who want local AI inference that "just works" without the complexity of larger platforms.
