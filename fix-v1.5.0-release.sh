echo "1. Delete the existing v1.5.0 release and tag:"
echo "   gh release delete v1.5.0 --yes"
echo "   git push --delete origin v1.5.0"
echo "   git tag -d v1.5.0"
echo ""
echo "2. Re-create the v1.5.0 tag:"
echo "   git tag v1.5.0"
echo "   git push origin v1.5.0"
echo ""
echo "3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:"
echo "   - Build binaries for all platforms"
echo "   - Publish to crates.io (with --allow-dirty flag)"
echo "   - Create GitHub release with binary assets"
echo ""
echo "Alternative: Create v1.5.1 patch release:"
echo "   - Update version in Cargo.toml to 1.5.1"
echo "   - Commit and tag as v1.5.1"
echo "   - Push tag to trigger release workflow"
echo ""
echo "The workflow fix ensures:"
echo "âœ… Cargo.lock changes don't block publishing"
echo "âœ… Binary building continues even if crates.io fails"
echo "âœ… GitHub release is created with all platform binaries"
